	The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system where
	documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locator
	(URLs, such as https://www.example.com/), which may be interlinked by hypertext,
	and are accessible over the Internet.[1] The resources of the WWW may be accessed
	by users by a software application called a web browser.
	English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the
	first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland.[2][3] The
	browser was released outside CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions starting in
	January 1991 and then to the general public in August 1991. The World Wide Web has been central
	to the development of the Information Age and is the primary tool billions of people use to
	content or the content depends upon the users or their actions. Websites may be provided for a
	myriad of informative, entertainment, commercial, governmental, or non-governmental reasons.
