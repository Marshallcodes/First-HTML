	In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself.
	Selectors may apply to the following:
	all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers h2

	id: an identifier unique within the document
	class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document
